## ABOUT THE CASE STUDY

This is one of the SQL case study provided by Data in Motion. More details about this case study can be found below.

An online bookstore that wants to maximize sales and customer pleasure is the subject of the case study. My job as a data analyst is to examine sales data and provide conclusions to enhance company performance. You can find patterns, client preferences, and growth prospects by examining data from your books, customers, orders, and sales. In order to increase sales and strengthen the position of the online bookshop in the marketplace, your analysis will help guide decisions about inventory management, marketing initiatives, and customer engagement.
